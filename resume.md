Command line geek who cares about design and has a strong affection for beautiful code.

## A Brief History
----------------

My love for programming all started at the tender age of 8 (1994) when I wrote
my first application using Visual Basic 4. When my Dad finally purchased
Internet access for the house, I quickly gained a fond appreciation for web
development. As I grew up, Linux, PHP, and MySQL became apart of me, as well
as dropping &lt;tables&gt; in favor of a more semantic web, and CSS.

After living in Japan attending college, I came back to America to pursue web
development as a career. Through the years I have learned a lot, and now spend
most of my time on the command line working with servers, writing code,
perfecting front ends, and discovering new ways to fulfill my inner geek.

## Recent Accomplishments
--------------
### [Kia Soul iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id556436565) _on iOS App Store_

An interactive experience where you “roll” a Kia Soul around and explore various
areas. A fun part was coding the audio visualizer on the top of the screen.

### Rack'em and Toby _on Github_

While architecting and developing a brand new CMS for clients, I created some open-source libraries for making application development much more friendly to PHP developers. Rack'em is a Rack inspired framework to give PHP web applications a common interface. Toby is a web application development framework built on top of Rack'em for creating web applications quick and easy.

### [My Botanic Planet](http://mybotanicplanet.com) _mybotanicplanet.com_

A flash experience designed to engage K-5 kids in the classroom and teach them
about the environment and their role in it. This site first launched in 2011,
and in March 2012, launched a new area (Water Ways) which included an orignal game concept I developed.
