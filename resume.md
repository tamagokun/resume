Command line geek who cares about design and has a strong affection for beautiful code.

## A Brief History
----------------

My love for programming all started at the tender age of 8 (1994) when I wrote
my first application using Visual Basic 4. When my Dad finally purchased
Internet access for the house, I quickly gained a fond appreciation for web
development. Through the years I would learn to wield Bash, PHP and MySQL, while
dropping &lt;tables&gt; in favor of a more semantic web, and CSS.

After landing a position with Organic, Inc., I would soon be introduced to Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Flash. These new found obsessions would mark my everlasting happiness of being a developer.

Being completely immersed in open-source and new technologies at MSL Detroit, my skills have matured and my quest to learn and explore has become never ending.

## Recent Accomplishments
--------------
### [GM Education](http://education.gm.com) _education.gm.com_

MSL has managed the education section of GM.com for many years. Before 2012, this site has been completely static as well as having very restrictive design limitations. Given the green light to refresh the site and its content using newer technologies, we created a wonderful Wordpress site to allow for dead simple content entry and powerful templating features.

### Rack'em and Toby _on Github_

While architecting and developing a brand new CMS for clients, I created some open-source libraries for making application development much more friendly to PHP developers. Rack'em is a Rack inspired framework to give PHP web applications a common interface. Toby is a web application development framework built on top of Rack'em for creating web applications quick and easy.

### [My Botanic Planet](http://mybotanicplanet.com) _mybotanicplanet.com_

A flash experience designed to engage K-5 kids in the classroom and teach them about the environment and their role in it. This site first launched in 2011, and in March 2012, we launched a new area (Water Ways) which included an orignal game concept I developed.
